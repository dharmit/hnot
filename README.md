Hacker News On Terminal aims to be a Go based TUI application that would
provide a CLI for accessing [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). I'm
trying to teach myself Go through this project.

### Features

Features I've planned to implement:

- [ ] A TUI based program that lists the top 30 articles from HN.
- [ ] Arrow keys to scroll up/down.
- [ ] Vim key-bindings, i.e., j, k keys can be used to scroll up/down.
- [ ] Space key to expand/close comments.
- [ ] Return key to open the article in a separate pane.

### Conribution

Happy to have from people experienced and inexperienced in Go alike.
